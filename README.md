flappy-demo
===========
In this app, I made a simple game look like flappy bird with javascript.

To make physical movement, I used Phaser which is a framework for making desktop and mobile browser HTML5 games.

Here is Phaser link doc: http://docs.phaser.io/

To run app, clone app from: "git@github.com:linuxhjkaru/flappy-demo.git" and run "index.html" file
